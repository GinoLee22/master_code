/**
 * Problem Description
 * Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.
 * The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.
 *
 * Example
 * For the following binary tree:
             4
            / \
           3   7
              / \
             5   6
 * LCA(3, 5) = 4
 * LCA(5, 6) = 7
 * LCA(6, 7) = 7
